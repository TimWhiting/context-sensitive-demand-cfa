  abstract = {We present a new Strong UPdate Analysis for C programs, called Supa, that enables computing points-to information on-demand via value-flow refinement, in environments with small time and memory budgets such as IDEs. We formulate Supa by solving a graph-reachability problem on a value- flow graph representation of the program, so that strong updates are performed where needed, as long as the total analysis budget is not exhausted. Supa facilitates efficiency and precision tradeoffs by allowing different pointer analyses to be applied in a hybrid multi-stage analysis framework. 
{\par}
We have implemented Supa in LLVM with its artifact available at [1]. We evaluate Supa by choosing uninitialized pointer detection as a major client on 12 open-source C programs. As the analysis budget increases, Supa achieves improved precision, with its single-stage flow-sensitive analysis reaching 97{\%} of that achieved by whole-program flow- sensitive analysis by consuming about 0.19 seconds and 36KB of memory per query, on average (with a budget of at most 10000 value-flow edges per query).},

In this paper we show how recently-developed techniques for incremental evaluation of logic programs can be refined and used for deriving practical implementations of incremental program analyzers. Incremental program analyzers compute the changes to the analysis information due to small changes in the input program rather than re-analyzing the program. Demand-driven analyzers compute only the information requested by the client analysis/optimization. We describe a framework based on logic programming for implementing program analyses that combines incremental and demand driven techniques. We show the effectiveness of this approach by building a practical incremental and demand-driven context insensitive points-to analysis and evaluating this implementation for analyzing C programs with 10-70K lines of code. Experiments show that our technique can compute the changes to analysis information due to small changes in the input program in, on the average, 6{\%} of the time it takes to reanalyze the program from scratch, and with little space overhead.},

  abstract = {Developing scalable and precise points-to analyses is increasingly important for analysing and optimising object-oriented programs where pointers are used pervasively. An incremental analysis for a program updates the existing analysis information after program changes to avoid reanalysing it from scratch. This can be efficiently deployed in software development environments where code changes are often small and frequent. This paper presents an incremental approach for demand-driven context-sensitive points-to analyses based on Context-Free Language (CFL) reachability. By tracing the CFL-reachable paths traversed in computing points-to sets, we can precisely identify and recompute on demand only the points-to sets affected by the program changes made. Combined with a flexible policy for controlling the granularity of traces, our analysis achieves significant speedups with little space overhead over reanalysis from scratch when evaluated with a null dereferencing client using 14 Java benchmarks.},

Modern demand-driven points-to or alias analysis techniques rest on the foundation of Context-Free Language (CFL) reachability. These techniques achieve high precision efficiently for a small number of queries raised in small programs but may still be too slow in answering many queries for large programs in a context-sensitive manner.
{\par}
We present an approach, called DynSum, to perform context-sensitive demand-driven points-to analysis fully on-demand by means of computing CFL-reachability summaries without any precision loss. The novelty lies in initially performing a \textit{Partial Points-To Analysis} (PPTA) within a method, which is field-sensitive but context-independent, to summarize its local points-to relations encountered during a query and reusing this information later in the same or different calling contexts. We have compared DynSum with RefinePTS, a refinement-based analysis, using three clients (safe casting, null dereferencing and factory methods) for a suite of nine Java programs. DynSum's average speedups are 1.95x, 2.28x and 1.37x, respectively. We have also compared DynSum with a static approach, which is referred to StaSum here, to show its improved scalability for the same three clients.},

In the case of Scala, it has been shown that its formal model, the Dependent Object Types (DOT) calculus, cannot simultaneously support key metatheoretic properties such as environment narrowing and subtyping transitivity, which are usually required for a type soundness proof. Moreover, Scala and many other realistic languages lack a general substitution property. 
{\par}
The first contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how type soundness proofs for advanced, polymorphic, type systems can be carried out with an operational semantics based on high-level, definitional interpreters, implemented in Coq. We present the first mechanized soundness proofs in this style for System F and several extensions, including mutable references. Our proofs use only straightforward induction, which is significant, as the combination of big-step semantics, mutable references, and polymorphism is commonly believed to require coinductive proof techniques. 
{\par}
The second main contribution of this paper is to show how DOT-like calculi emerge from straightforward generalizations of the operational aspects of F, exposing a rich design space of calculi with path-dependent types inbetween System F and DOT, which we dub the System D Square. 
{\par}
By working directly on the target language, definitional interpreters can focus the design space and expose the invariants that actually matter at runtime. Looking at such runtime invariants is an exciting new avenue for type system design.},

Alone, each method reduces analysis times and boosts precision by orders of magnitude. This work illuminates and conquers the theoretical challenges that stand in the way of combining the power of these techniques. The challenge in marrying these techniques is not subtle: computing the reachable control states of a pushdown system relies on limiting access during transition to the top of the stack; abstract garbage collection, on the other hand, needs full access to the entire stack to compute a root set, just as concrete collection does. \textit{Introspective} pushdown systems resolve this conflict. Introspective pushdown systems provide enough access to the stack to allow abstract garbage collection, but they remain restricted enough to compute control-state reachability, thereby enabling the sound and precise product of pushdown analysis and abstract garbage collection. Experiments reveal synergistic interplay between the techniques, and the fusion demonstrates {\textquotedbl}better-than-both-worlds{\textquotedbl} precision.},

  abstract = {The strength of a dynamic language is also its weakness: run-time flexibility comes at the cost of compile-time predictability. Many of the hallmarks of dynamic languages such as closures, continuations, various forms of reflection, and a lack of static types make many programmers rejoice, while compiler writers, tool developers, and verification engineers lament. The dynamism of these features simply confounds statically reasoning about programs that use them. Consequently, static analyses for dynamic languages are few, far between, and seldom sound.
{\par}
The {\textquotedbl}abstracting abstract machines{\textquotedbl} (AAM) approach to constructing static analyses has recently been proposed as a method to ameliorate the difficulty of designing analyses for such language features. The approach, so called because it derives a function for the sound and computable approximation of program behavior starting from the abstract machine semantics of a language, provides a viable approach to dynamic language analysis since all that is required is a machine description of the interpreter.
{\par}
The AAM recipe as originally described produces finite state abstractions: the behavior of a program is approximated as a finite state machine. Such a model is inherently imprecise when it comes to reasoning about the control stack of the interpreter: a finite state machine cannot faithfully represent a stack. Recent advances have shown that higher-order programs can be approximated with pushdown systems. However, such models, founded in automata theory, either breakdown or require significant engineering in the face of dynamic language features that inspect or modify the control stack.
{\par}
In this paper, we tackle the problem of bringing pushdown flow analysis to the domain of dynamic language features. We revise the abstracting abstract machines technique to target the stronger computational model of pushdown systems. In place of automata theory, we use only abstract machines and memoization. As case studies, we show the technique applies to a language with closures, garbage collection, stack-inspection, and first-class composable continuations.},

  abstract = {Abstracting abstract machines is a systematic methodology for constructing sound static analyses for higher-order languages, by deriving small-step abstract abstract machines (AAMs) that perform abstract interpretation from abstract machines that perform concrete evaluation. Darais et al. apply the same underlying idea to monadic definitional interpreters, and obtain monadic abstract definitional interpreters (ADIs) that perform abstract interpretation in big-step style using monads. Yet, the relation between small-step abstract abstract machines and big-step abstract definitional interpreters is not well studied. 
{\par}
In this paper, we explain their functional correspondence and demonstrate how to systematically transform small-step abstract abstract machines into big-step abstract definitional interpreters. Building on known semantic interderivation techniques from the concrete evaluation setting, the transformations include linearization, lightweight fusion, disentanglement, refunctionalization, and the left inverse of the CPS transform. Linearization expresses nondeterministic choice through first-order data types, after which refunctionalization transforms the first-order data types that represent continuations into higher-order functions. The refunctionalized AAM is an abstract interpreter written in continuation-passing style (CPS) with two layers of continuations, which can be converted back to direct style with delimited control operators. Based on the known correspondence between delimited control and monads, we demonstrate that the explicit use of monads in abstract definitional interpreters is optional. 
{\par}
All transformations properly handle the collecting semantics and nondeterminism of abstract interpretation. Remarkably, we reveal how precise call/return matching in control-flow analysis can be obtained by refunctionalizing a small-step abstract abstract machine with proper caching.},

  abstract = {In this functional pearl, we examine the use of definitional interpreters as a basis for abstract interpretation of higher-order programming languages. As it turns out, definitional interpreters, especially those written in monadic style, can provide a nice basis for a wide variety of collecting semantics, abstract interpretations, symbolic executions, and their intermixings. 
{\par}
But the real insight of this story is a replaying of an insight from Reynold's landmark paper, \emph{Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages}, in which he observes definitional interpreters enable the defined-language to inherit properties of the defining-language. We show the same holds true for definitional \emph{abstract} interpreters. Remarkably, we observe that abstract definitional interpreters can inherit the so-called {\textquotedblleft}pushdown control flow{\textquotedblright} property, wherein function calls and returns are precisely matched in the abstract semantics, simply by virtue of the function call mechanism of the defining-language. 
{\par}
The first approaches to achieve this property for higher-order languages appeared within the last ten years, and have since been the subject of many papers. These approaches start from a state-machine semantics and uniformly involve significant technical engineering to recover the precision of pushdown control flow. In contrast, starting from a definitional interpreter, the pushdown control flow property is inherent in the meta-language and requires no further technical mechanism to achieve.},

  abstract = {We describe a derivational approach to abstract interpretation that yields novel and transparently sound static analyses when applied to well-established abstract machines. To demonstrate the technique and support our claim, we transform the CEK machine of Felleisen and Friedman, a lazy variant of Krivine's machine, and the stack-inspecting CM machine of Clements and Felleisen into abstract interpretations of themselves. The resulting analyses bound temporal ordering of program events; predict return-flow and stack-inspection behavior; and approximate the flow and evaluation of by-need parameters. For all of these machines, we find that a series of well-known concrete machine refactorings, plus a technique we call store-allocated continuations, leads to machines that abstract into static analyses simply by bounding their stores. We demonstrate that the technique scales up uniformly to allow static analysis of realistic language features, including tail calls, conditionals, side effects, exceptions, first-class continuations, and even garbage collection.},

We then prove the semantic soundness of the collecting semantics and that all totally deterministic instantiations have a least solution; this incorporates \textit{k}-CFA, polymorphic splitting and a new class of uniform-\textit{k}-CFA analyses.},

Our technique is demand-driven, performing only the work necessary to answer each query (a request for a variable's points-to information) issued by a client. In cases where even the demand-driven approach exceeds the time budget for a query, we employ \textit{early termination}, \textit{i.e.}, stopping the analysis prematurely and returning an over-approximated result to the client. Our technique improves on previous demand-driven points-to analysis algorithms [17, 33] by achieving much higher precision under small time budgets and early termination.We formulate Andersen's analysis [5] for Java as a CFL-reachability problem [33]. This formulation shows that Andersen's analysis for Java is a \textit{balanced-parentheses problem}, an insight that enables our new techniques. We exploit the balanced parentheses structure to approximate Andersen's analysis by \textit{regularizing} the CFL-reachability problem, yielding an asymptotically cheaper algorithm. We also show how to regain most of the precision lost in the regular approximation as needed through \textit{refinement}. Our evaluation shows that our regularization and refinement approach achieves nearly the precision of field-sensitive Andersen's analysis in time budgets as small as 2ms per query. Our technique can yield speedups of up to 16x over computing an exhaustive Andersen's analysis for some clients, with little to no precision loss.},

Previous work [21] has shown that all three properties are important for precisely analyzing large programs, e.g., to show safety of downcasts. Existing analyses typically give up one or more of the properties for scalability. We have developed a refinement-based analysis that succeeds by simultaneously refining handling of method calls and heap accesses, allowing the analysis to precisely analyze important code while entirely skipping irrelevant code. The analysis is demanddriven and client-driven, facilitating refinement specific to each queried variable and increasing scalability. In our experimental evaluation, our analysis proved the safety of 61{\%} more casts than one of the most precise existing analyses across a suite of large benchmarks. The analysis checked the casts in under 13 minutes per benchmark (taking less than 1 second per query) and required only 35MB of memory, far less than previous approaches.},

This prevents flow sets from merging in the abstract, which has two immediate effects: (1) the precision of the analysis is increased, and (2) the running time of the analysis is frequently reduced. In some nontrivial cases, we achieve an order of magnitude improvement in precision and time \textit{simultaneously}.In abstract counting, we track how many times an abstract resource has been allocated. A count of one implies that the abstract resource momentarily represents only one concrete resource. This, in turn, allows us to perform environment analysis and to expand the kinds (rather than just the degree) of optimizations available to the compiler.},

Yet for a given language or analysis feature, it often requires tedious and error prone work to implement an analyzer and prove it sound. In short, static analysis features and their proofs of soundness do not compose well, causing a dearth of reuse in both implementation and metatheory. We solve the problem of systematically constructing static analyzers by introducing Galois transformers: monad transformers that transport Galois connection properties. In concert with a monadic interpreter, we define a library of monad transformers that implement building blocks for classic analysis parameters like context, path, and heap (in)sensitivity. Moreover, these can be composed together independent of the language being analyzed. Significantly, a Galois transformer can be proved sound once and for all, making it a reusable analysis component. As new analysis features and abstractions are developed and mixed in, soundness proofs need not be reconstructed, as the composition of a monad transformer stack is sound by virtue of its constituents. Galois transformers provide a viable foundation for reusable and composable metatheory for program analysis. Finally, these Galois transformers shift the level of abstraction in analysis design and implementation to a level where non-specialists have the ability to synthesize sound analyzers over a number of parameters.},

  abstract = {Traditional control-flow analysis (CFA) for higher-order languages introduces spurious connections between callers and callees, and different invocations of a function may pollute each other's return flows. Recently, three distinct approaches have been published that provide perfect call-stack precision in a computable manner: CFA2, PDCFA, and AAC. Unfortunately, implementing CFA2 and PDCFA requires significant engineering effort. Furthermore, all three are computationally expensive. For a monovariant analysis, CFA2 is in O(2^n), PDCFA is in O(n^6), and AAC is in O(n^8). In this paper, we describe a new technique that builds on these but is both straightforward to implement and computationally inexpensive. The crucial insight is an unusual state-dependent allocation strategy for the addresses of continuations. Our technique imposes only a constant-factor overhead on the underlying analysis and costs only O(n^3) in the monovariant case. We present the intuitions behind this development, benchmarks demonstrating its efficacy, and a proof of the precision of this analysis.},

  abstract = {Foundational proof assistants simultaneously offer both expressive logics and strong guarantees. The price they pay for this flexibility is often the need to build and check explicit proof objects which can be expensive. In this work we develop a collection of techniques for building reflective automation, where proofs are witnessed by verified decision procedures rather than verbose proof objects. Our techniques center around a verified domain specific language for proving, \(\mathcal {R}_{tac}\), written in Gallina, Coq{\textquoteright}s logic. The design of tactics makes it easy to combine them into higher-level automation that can be proved sound in a mostly automated way. Furthermore, unlike traditional uses of reflection, \(\mathcal {R}_{tac}\) tactics are independent of the underlying problem domain, which allows them to be re-tasked to automate new problems with very little effort. We demonstrate the usability of \(\mathcal {R}_{tac}\) through several case studies demonstrating orders of magnitude speedups for relatively little engineering work.},

The analysis described in this article unifies and extends previous work on flow analysis for higher-order languages supporting assignment and control operators. The analysis is abstract interpretation based and is parameterized over two polyvariance operators and a projection operator. These operators are used to regulate the speed and accuracy of the analysis. An implementation of the analysis is incorporated into and used in a production Scheme compiler. The analysis can process any legal Scheme program without modification. Others have demonstrated that a 0CFA analysis can enables the optimizations, but a 0CFA analysis is \textit{O}(\textit{n})\textsuperscript{3}). An \textit{O}(\textit{n}) instantiation of our analysis successfully enables the optimization of closure representations and procedure calls. Experiments with the cheaper instantiation show that it is as effective as 0CFA for these optimizations.},

The framework unifies and extends previous work on flow analyses for this class of programming languages. The analysis is based on abstract interpretation and is parameterized over the abstraction of literals, two polyvariance operators, and a projection operator. The polyvariance operators regulate the accuracy of the analysis while the projection operator regulates the speed. A preliminary implementation of the analysis is incorporated and used in a production-quality Scheme compiler. The analysis can process any legal Scheme program without modification. While it has been demonstrated that analyses at least as accurate as OCFA are useful for justifying program transformations, an instantiation of this analysis less precise than OCFA is used to facilitate loop recognition, eliminate the construction of closures, and optimize procedure calls. This demonstrates that relatively inaccurate analyses can still be useful for justifying transformations.},

Despite the similarities, the vocabulary and results in the two communities remain largely distinct, with limited cross-understanding. One of the few links is Shivers's \textit{k}-CFA work, which has advanced the concept of {\textquotedbl}context-sensitive analysis{\textquotedbl} and is widely known in both communities.
{\par}
Recent results indicate that the relationship between the functional and object-oriented incarnations of \textit{k}-CFA is not as well understood as thought. Van Horn and Mairson proved \textit{k}-CFA for \textit{k} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 1 to be EXPTIME-complete; hence, no polynomial-time algorithm can exist. Yet, there are several polynomial-time formulations of context-sensitive points-to analyses in object-oriented languages. Thus, it seems that functional \textit{k}-CFA may actually be a profoundly different analysis from object-oriented \textit{k}-CFA. We resolve this paradox by showing that the exact same specification of \textit{k}-CFA is polynomial-time for object-oriented languages yet exponential-time for functional ones: objects and closures are subtly different, in a way that interacts crucially with context-sensitivity and complexity. This illumination leads to an immediate payoff: by projecting the object-oriented treatment of objects onto closures, we derive a polynomial-time hierarchy of context-sensitive CFAs for functional programs.},

In this article, we present a general framework for developing demand-driven interprocedural data flow analyzers and report our experience in evaluating the performance of this approach. A demand for data flow information is modeled as a set of queries. The framework includes a generic demand-driven algorithm that determines the response to query by iteratively applying a system of query propagation rules. The propagation rules yield precise responses for the class of distributive finite data flow problems. We also describe a two-phase framework variation to accurately handle nondistributive problems. A performance evaluation of our demand-driven approach is presented for two data flow problems, namely, reaching-definitions and copy constant propagation. Our experiments show that demand-driven analysis performs well in practice, reducing both time and space requirements when compared with exhaustive analysis.},

  abstract = {Object-sensitivity has emerged as an excellent context abstraction for points-to analysis in object-oriented languages. Despite its practical success, however, object-sensitivity is poorly understood. For instance, for a context depth of 2 or higher, past scalable implementations deviate significantly from the original definition of an object-sensitive analysis. The reason is that the analysis has many degrees of freedom, relating to which context elements are picked at every method call and object creation. We offer a clean model for the analysis design space, and discuss a formal and informal understanding of object-sensitivity and of how to create good object-sensitive analyses. The results are surprising in their extent. We find that past implementations have made a sub-optimal choice of contexts, to the severe detriment of precision and performance. We define a {\textquotedbl}full-object-sensitive{\textquotedbl} analysis that results in significantly higher precision, and often performance, for the exact same context depth. We also introduce {\textquotedbl}type-sensitivity{\textquotedbl} as an explicit approximation of object-sensitivity that preserves high context quality at substantially reduced cost. A type-sensitive points-to analysis makes an unconventional use of types as context: the context types are not dynamic types of objects involved in the analysis, but instead upper bounds on the dynamic types of their allocator objects. Our results expose the influence of context choice on the quality of points-to analysis and demonstrate type-sensitivity to be an idea with major impact: It decisively advances the state-of-the-art with a spectrum of analyses that simultaneously enjoy speed (several times faster than an analogous object-sensitive analysis), scalability (comparable to analyses with much less context-sensitivity), and precision (comparable to the best object-sensitive analysis with the same context depth).},

This book contains the three parts comprising 'R6RS', the sixth revision of a series of reports describing the programming language Scheme. The book is divided into parts: a description of the language itself, a description of the standard libraries and non-normative appendices. Early chapters introduce Scheme and later chapters act as a reference manual. This is an important report for programmers that work with or want to learn about the Scheme language.},
